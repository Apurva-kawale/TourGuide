    </h1>
    <div>
        <p id="intro">


            Agra is a city offering a discovery of the beautiful era. Agra has a rich history, reflected in its numerous monuments dotted in and around the city. The earliest citation for Agra comes from the mythological era, where the epic Mahabharata refer Agra
            as ‘Agravana’ meaning paradise in Sanskrit. ‘Ptolemy’, the famous second century A.D. geographer, was the first person who referred Agra with its modern name. The Modern Agra was founded by Sikandar Lodi, ruler of Lodi dynasty in 16th century.
            It was when Shah Jahan descended the Mughal throne that Agra reached the zenith of architectural beauty. The city lies in the Western part of Uttar Pradesh on the bank of River Yamuna. Though the wonderful allure of the Taj Mahal attracts
            people from around the world over to Agra, it is not a standalone attraction. The city offers a trail of fascinating tombs and mausoleums to explore. Acclaimed for its lavish crafts like Pietra Dura (marble inlay) work, rugs and leather goods,
            and the luscious Petha, Agra equally caters well to shopaholics and foodies.

            The Taj Mahal is one of the three World Heritage Sites in India. Set in a serene Mughal Garden the monument stands on a raised marble platform, with its back towards Yamuna River. The four sides of the Taj Mahal show a perfect symmetry and feature impressive
            vaulted arches embellished with Pietra Dura scrollwork, and verses from the Quran in calligraphy using inlaid jasper. This architectural masterpiece is one of the most frequented places in India by photographers and foreign tourists. The Taj

        <img src="/images/Agra Fort Agra.jpeg">
        <p id="attrinfo">
            A massive red-sandstone fort located on the banks of River Yamuna was built under the commission of Emperor Akbar in 1565 and was further built by his grandson Shah Jahan. The fort, semi-circular on plan, is surrounded by a 21.4 m high fortification wall.
            The fort was built primarily as a military structure; parts of it are still reserved under Indian Army. Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658.
            The fort houses a maze of buildings, including vast underground sections. The Amar Singh Gate to the south is the sole entry point. A path leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid. Just before this is the open Diwan-e-Aam, where
            Shah Jahan listened to people’s petitions or issues. A small staircase just to the left of Diwan-e-Aam throne leads up to a large courtyard. To the left is a beautiful white marble Nagina Masjid. Other places to see within the Fort are: Diwan-e-Khas
            - which once housed Shah Jahan’s legendary Peacock throne and the diamond Koh-I-Noor, Shish Mahal- a palace with walls inlaid with tiny mirrors, and Khas Mahal - the white octagonal tower and palace. In the South of the fort, there is a huge
            red-sandstone Jahangir’s Palace, built by Akbar probably for his son Jahangir.
